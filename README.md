# STAT4188

At University of Connecticut spring semester 2024 I took a class called STAT 4188 Advanced Data Analytics with Python. In this class learned useful skills in data science and analytics. In this repository, I will attach assignments for the semester that I have completed. Assignemnts were on web scrapping, numpy, pandas, multi linear regression models and data modeling.
