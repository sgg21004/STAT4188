At University of Connecticut this past spring 2024 semester, I took a class called STAT 4188: Advanced Data Analytics with Python in which I learned alot about data science and analytics in different areas. In this repository, I have attached my assignemnts I have completed throughout the semester and projects in areas liek web scrapping, numpy, pandas, linear regression models and data modeling/processing.
